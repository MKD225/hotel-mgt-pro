<p>After some debate about the exact site for the tower, a contract
	was finally signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting
	in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company,
	and granted him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less
	than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to
	receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during
	the exhibition and for the following twenty years. Eiffel later
	established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the
	necessary capital himself</p>
